<h1>PushButton Engine Manual</h1>

<p>Welcome to the PushButton Engine! <a href="http://www.pushbuttonengine.com/">PushButton Engine</a> is an open source Flash game framework.</p>

<p>This manual covers the basics of developing with the PushButton Engine. The various sections linked on this page cover different parts of the engine. Everything from <a href="#Lessons">lessons on how to get started</a> to <a href="#videos">video talks about the engine</a> to <a href="#Reference">references on many subsystems in the engine</a> are included.</P>

<p>The most important part of PushButton Engine is its community. Be sure to visit our <a href="http://www.pushbuttonengine.com/community/">community page</a> to see what's going on in the forums, what the latest PBE games are, and more.</p>

<h2>First Steps: PBE In 30 Seconds</h2>
	
<p>Here is everything you need to know about PBE in a short list:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Download PBE <a href="http://www.pushbuttonengine.com/download">here</a>, or get it <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pushbuttonengine/source/checkout">from our Google Code SVN</a>.
	<li>The engine code is in src/. The SWC is in bin/ (if you downloaded a zip).</li>
	<li>Here is the <a href="http://pbe.zaalabs.com/api/index.html">API reference</a>.</li>
	<li>See <a href="#Lessons">Lesson #1</a> for details on how to get started with using PBE, including how to set it up with your favorite Flash tool/IDE.</li>
	<li>Visit our <a href="#GettingStartTutorials">community forums, and IRC.</a>
</ol>

<p>If you like more verbose explanations, we have an <a href="overview.html">overview</a> that explains what PushButton Engine all about, what component are, and how everything fits together.</p>

<h2><a name="GettingStartTutorials">Community</a></h2>

<p>Our community is built around teaching people how to build great Flash games using PushButton Engine. We expect PBE users to have some programming background, but if you run into problems, please visit our <a href="http://www.pushbuttonengine.com/forum/">forums and let us know</a>. We are always improving.</p>

<p>The best place to get involved in our community is on the <a href="http://www.pushbuttonengine.com/community/">PushButton Engine community page</a> and on our IRC channel (<a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">#pbengine on freenode.net</a>).</p>

<p>PBE community member Mas runs the <a href="http://blog.makeyourflashgame.com/">MakeYourFlashGame blog</a> where you can find <a href="http://blog.makeyourflashgame.com/tag/pbengine">a series of good articles and tutorials on PBE</a>.</p>
